    "# Predicting Stock Price Movement Through Natural Language Processing with SEC Filings \n",
    "\n",
    "By Kevin Zhou (`klz23`), Ashley Young (`acy39`), Peter Wu (`plw53`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a model that can predict how a companyâ€™s stock will change 90 days after it releases its quarterly or annual reports to the SEC. There have been studies and on average, a stock will move around post announcement based on the financial statements as well as the contents of the 10-K/10-Q. Our goal is to interpret the contents of the filings and see how the stock price will move based on prior filings and prior stock price movements. "
