## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- python3.8-venv

## Setup

- Run `python3 -m venv env` to create a virtual environment to make sure dependencies don't
pollute your own installation.
- Activate the virtual environment with `source env/bin/activate`.
- Install the necessary dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Now, whenever you add some new dependencies, be sure to `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to make sure
your results are reproducible.
